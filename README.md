## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Rivaldy. I'm a web developer. I put my passion in web development especially web UI/front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even so, 
I don't hate back-end things. Sometimes I use back-end technology like PHP and its framework (CodeIgniter or Laravel) for building dynamic website.

Moreover, I also have an interest in graphic design. Sometimes I do design with Adobe Photoshop or similar software. Of course I'm not an expert on this particular thing, just an enthusiast.
