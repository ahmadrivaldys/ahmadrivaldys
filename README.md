# Hi there! I'm Aldy, a Web Developer ðŸ‘‹


What I usually do as a developer is mostly doing front-end stuff like turning designs into codes. Well, I put my passion in web development especially web UI/front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Even so, I don't hate back-end things. Sometimes I use back-end technology like PHP or Node.js and its framework for building dynamic website, or when I do full-stack work.
