## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Rivaldy, web developer. What I usually do as a developer is mostly doing front-end stuff like turning designs into codes. Well, I put my passion in web development especially web UI/front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Even so, I don't hate back-end things. Sometimes I use back-end technology like PHP or Node.js and its framework for building dynamic website, or when I do full-stack work.


## Current job
Currently working as a **Full-Stack Developer** at PT Code Development Indonesia. Work together as a team to build and develop web 
applications with specific programming languages and frameworks. For more completely about my working experiences and portfolio, please check it out
